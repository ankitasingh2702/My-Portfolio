        <img src="besan-ladoo.jpg" alt="Besan Ladoo" class="center">
        <p>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b> </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> ⅓ cup Ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li> 1 cup Besan (gram flour)</li>
            <li>½ cup Powdered sugar (Confectioner’s sugar or icing sugar) (tagar or boora)</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon Green cardamom seeds powder⅓ cup Ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li> 1 cup Besan (gram flour)</li>
            <li> ½ cup Powdered sugar (Confectioner’s sugar or icing sugar) (tagar or boora)</li>
            <li> ⅛ teaspoon Green cardamom seeds powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Method</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Heat the ghee or clarified butter in a pan on LOW heat. Once hot add besan and mix.</li>
            <li>Roast the besan on low flame with stirring continuously. In the beginning, it will be a little lumpy.
                Keep on stirring and cooking.</li>
            <li>As it gets roasted, it starts to loosen up. Continue cooking, it will not be lumpy anymore. You will
                feel little light while</br> stirring and then it starts to change color (golden), you will have a nutty
                aroma of cooked besan and will be paste-like and </br>shiny – meaning ghee starts oozing out. It took me
                about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove it to a plate. Let it cool to touch or let it get warm.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture becomes warm, add powdered sugar and cardamom powder. Start mixing with your
                fingertips. </br>It will come together like a loose dough
            <li>Shape into the ladoo and place on the plate. As the mixture is loose and warm, besan ladoo will not hold
                its round shape</br> and will become flat. No worries. After some time it cools down (about 15 minutes
                later).</br>Then again shape into the round ladoo. Now it will hold its round shape. But be sure, don’t
                wait too long to cool down. </br>Otherwise, it will get firm.</li>
            <li>Garnish them with chopped nuts or charoli.</li>

        <h1><b>Coconut Ladoo</b></h1>
        <img src="coconut-ladoo.jpg" alt="Coconut Ladoo" class="center1">
        <p>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 ½ cups Coconut (frozen or fresh), grated</li>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) Sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Green cardamom seeds powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Almonds finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Cashew nuts finely chopped</li>
            <li>4-5 tablespoons Desiccated coconut</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3><b>Method</b></h3>
            <li>Take coconut in a pan on medium heat. Roast for 2-3 minutes or till the moisture is gone. No need to
                brown them,</br> I have cooked coconut first because it was frozen. You can skip roasting them if using
                freshly grated.</li>
            <li>Then add condensed milk, Mix and let it simmer and cook. Do stir occasionally in the beginning. Then
                stir continuously as it</br> starts to thicken more.</li>
            <li>Cook till it is thick and no more moisture left (meaning you don’t see any bubbles from the sides). It
                took me around 10 minutes. </br>Turn off the stove.</li>
            <li>Add cardamom powder, almonds, cashews, and mix.</li>
            <li>Remove it to a bowl and let it cool down to touch.</li>
            <li>Grease your palm with ghee, take a small portion of the cooled mixture and start shaping into a ball.
                (see the video to learn how</br> to shape). Make a tight, smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Then roll the ladoo into dry coconut and place it on the plate.</li>
            <li>Repeat the same for rest.</li>

        <h1><b>Kalakand Recipe</b></h1>
        <img src="kalakand.jpg" alt="Kalakand Recipe" class="center">
        <p>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> ⅔ cup Paneer Crumbled and tightly packed (if you want to make fresh paneer, see the notes)</li>
            <li> 1 ½ cups Milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup Sugar</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon Green cardamom seeds powder</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons Pistachios chopped for garnishing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Method</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Take milk in a wide mouth pan and bring it to a boil and simmer for 5-6 minutes or till it thickens. Do
                stir to make </br>sure that it is not sticking to the pan.</li>
            <li> Side-by-side also crumble the paneer and keep it ready.</li>
            <li> Now add sugar, mix and simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now add crumbled paneer and mix. Cook with stirring constantly till all the moisture is evaporated and
                no more bubbly.</li>
            <li> How do you know it is ready? you will notice the mixture is thick but bubbles are forming around the
                edges.</br> Meaning it is not yet ready, continue cooking till no more bubbles are forming.</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove, add cardamom powder and mix.</li>
            <li> Grease the plate or container with ghee. In that pour the mixture and spread out evenly. Sprinkle the
                chopped </br>pistachios on top. Using hands, lightly press it so pistachios will stick to the kalakand.
            </li>
            <li> Let it cool down completely and let it set. Then using a sharp knife make square pieces. Remove the
                pieces gently and serve.</li>

        <h1 ><b>Kaju Katli</b></h1>
        <img src="kaju.jpg" alt="Kaju Katli" class="center3">
        <p>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 260 grams or 2 cups Cashew nuts</li>
            <li>150 grams or ¾ cup White granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup Water</li>
            <li>Edible silver leaf (Varakh) as needed optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Method</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Making Cashew Powder: First, remove the required amount of cashews from the fridge and let</br> them come to
                room temperature. It may take 1-2 hours. This is an important step and you cannot skip it.</li>
            <li> Take that into a food processor and make powder by using the pulse button. Do not over-grind</br> otherwise,
                it starts to release the oil and becomes wet, pasty. We need dry powder here.</li>
            <li> Cooking The Mixture: Take sugar and water in a heavy bottom pan on medium-low heat.</br> Let it just
                come to a boil (no need to simmer).</li>

            <li> As soon as it starts boiling add cashew powder, mix it and cook with stirring constantly.</li>
            <li> As it gets cooked, it starts to get thick and leaves the sides of the pan. Do not scrap the thin layer
                that stuck to the </br>pan as it has become chewy now.</li>
            <li> Keep cooking until it comes together like a dough. Depending on the gas heat and size/shape of the
                pan,</br>
                it may take around 8-10 minutes. CHECK: take a small portion, blow it so it is touchable, make a small</br>
                ball and If it is sticking to the finger it needs more cooking. If not sticking then it is ready.</li>
            <li> Remove it to a greased plate and let it cool to touch. It should be warm (not cooled completely).</li>
            <li>Kneading, Rolling & Cutting: Once it is cool to handle, grease your hand with ghee and knead it
                two-three times,</br> make a smooth dough. DO NOT over-knead it.</li>
            <li> Now take a big piece of parchment paper. Put the dough ball on it and using your hand start patting and
                make a thick round patty.</br> So now it will be easier to roll. Cover the dough with another piece of
                parchment paper and start rolling. The thickness should </br>be ¼ inch to ⅓ inch. Do not roll it too
                thin. The circle was approx. 10-12 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT NOTE: do the kneading and rolling job while the dough is still warm. If it gets cool, it will
                start to set and </br>becomes hard to roll.
                using a knife cut into a diamond shape. Now let it cool completely and set. It may take around 5-10
                minutes.</li>
            <li> Now apply the silver leaf on top. This is optional but it looks good and just like the store-bought
                kind. Working with varak is very tricky,</br> you have to be very careful and do not touch it with your
                hand. </li>

            <li> Take milk into a heavy bottom pan and bring it to a simmer on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Meantime take rasgullas, lightly squeeze to remove the syrup. Do not squeeze too hard that it crumbles
                or break. Prep all them similarly and keep it aside.</li>
            <li>Now back to the simmering milk. Keep stirring and scraping the sides of the pan. Simmer till its reaches
                its half quantity. It may take around 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now add sugar and saffron, again simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Now add squeezed ragulla. And let it simmer for 2 minutes only and turn off the stove. In the end, add
                rose water and mix.</li>
            <li>Now let it cool to room temperature and then chill rasmalai into the refrigerator. At the time of
                serving garnish with sliced almonds.</li>
